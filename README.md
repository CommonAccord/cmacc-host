# cmacc-host<br>
A bare folder and some stubs for the CommonAccord application.  <br>

Mount this where you want your application webserver to be.  Add in:<ol><li>

  In the folder /vendor/ clone in the code to run it - github.com/CommonAccord/cmacc-app.  (You should end up with the code at /vendor/cmacc-app/*)<li>

  In the folder /Doc/ clone in the document sets that you want.  You will very likely need at least CmaccDoc-Z - mount it as /Doc/Z/.</ol>

You will need the basic web server LAMP stack (for instance MAMP).<br>

If all goes well, you will have a working instance.<br>  

You can add files using a text editor, move files using a file manager, edit files with an editor or the "Edit" view in the app.  If you use an IDE - for instance Emacs - you can make edits across groups of files and otherwise improve your productivity.
